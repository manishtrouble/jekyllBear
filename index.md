## Manish Mishra's Landing
Hello there, I'm Manish. Welcome to my corner of the internet.

I love Math, Music, and Cinema.
I am a full time Data Scientist at [Aganitha](https://aganitha.ai), an occasional quizzer and a compulsive punner (or *pun*star. or *pun*dit?).

I ask weird questions like [where is "Old Zealand"?](https://www.britannica.com/story/where-is-old-zealand)

Currently, I am building AI solutions to accelerate drug discovery, building and maintaining backend services, and dabbling with DevOps. I am also writing about [Intuitions in Linear Algebra](https://example.com).

Outside of work, you can find me [Inside A New Rabbit Hole](https://example.com).

You can check out my:\
[Blog](https://manish-m.com/blog): where I write about everything\
[Projects](https://example.com): where I experiment\
[Life](https://manish-m.com/life): where I document my life in weeks\
[Resume](/assets/resume.pdf): where I fail to put it all together in one page. Please check it out :)
